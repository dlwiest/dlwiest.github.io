<!--
    Oh hey, thanks for taking an interest in my code!
    I decided to go back to basics for my portfolio page -- good old vanilla JS and CSS.
    The only imports here are the fonts. Performance benefits aside, building this way was incredibly
    cathartic. If you've been stuck in framework land for a while, I'd strongly recommend giving vanilla
    a shot.

    fyi this site should navigate smooothly in both desktop and mobile environments and should degrade
    gracefully if JavaScript is disabled in your browser. If you happen to spot any issues, please let me know!

                                <p>In July 2024, Brendan Turner (creator of <a href="https://pindigo.app/" target="_blank">Pindigo</a>) and I teamed up to create PinHub as a one stop shop for all of your pinball needs. One month later, we launched a public beta of the app featuring a machine search, news aggregation, an events calendar, and an interactive map. PinHub currently includes offers basic support for user authentication and profiles, which we're working on expanding to a suite of social features like machine reviews, user-submitted tips and discussions. Finally, we plan to add a pinball marketplace early 2025.</p>
                                <p>PinHub is currently live at <a href="https://pinhub.gg" target="_blank">pinhub.gg</a>.</p>

                                <h3>JukeRabbit</h3>
                                <span class="title">Founder</span>

                                <p>JukeRabbit is a passion project I'd been contemplating for a long time since witnessing on many occasions aux access leading to tension at parties. With JukeRabbit, I set out to solve this problem by creating essentially a TouchTunes for house parties: the host creates a session, connects to their speakers via Bluetooth or aux, and receives a six-digit access code to share with their guests. Anyone with the access code is then able to able to connect through the app to see what's currently playing, request new songs, and to watch the playlist develop in real time. The benefit over Spotify Jams, aside from guests not needing Spotify accounts (although those who do are able to queue songs from their own playlists), is that instead of just appending new requests to the end of the queue, JukeRabbit intelligently prioritizes requests based on how long since the guest had last heard one of their picks. It also provides an auto-DJ function that adds new songs to the list based on what's been played so far when it runs out of requests.</p>
                                <p>An early version of JukeRabbit (then called FreeJ) worked by leveraging an exploit in the Linux Spotify client that allowed other applications to issue commands. Usability was limited, however, due to the need for the host to run JukeRabbit as a server on a Linux machine. The release of Spotify's Web Playback SDK enabled a much more user-friendly version that allowed anyone to host a JukeRabbit session simply by connecting to the web app and authorizing Spotify.
                                <p>The ability to host JukeRabbit sessions is currently restricted to whitelisted users pending official approval from Spotify, but it's been a big hit at my own events, and I'm excited to release it to the public. If you're curious to see how it works, I'd be happy to set up a demo. The app is currently live at <a href="https://jukerabbit.io" target="_blank">jukerabbit.io</a>.</p>

                                    <p>When I joined JazzHR, the company had recently resolved to migrate from AngularJS to React. This presented some interesting challenges: the front end had evolved over a decade, through multiple eras of JavaScript standards, and relied heavily on services that were tightly coupled with Angular code. Given that a complete overhaul was off the table, the two frameworks would need to coexist as we iteratively migrated away from AngularJS. Thanks to my extensive experience with React, I was able to employ out-of-the-box solutions to overcome the biggest hurdles and lay the groundwork for a smooth transition.</p>

                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>My web development journey began at ten years old when I built my first website — a fan page and info repository for my favorite Nickelodeon show — with the help of various online resources and by scanning the source of other sites I admired. Although it was only a simple, static site, it inspired a curiosity about programming, and I soon branched out to JavaScript and, eventually, PHP and MySQL as well. By high school, I was regularly building small utility apps and browser games, in addition to helping maintain the district website.</p>
                    <p>After college, while pursuing a career in writing, I continued to hone my coding skills, driven by a love for problem solving and the efficiency of automating common tasks like comparing the price of books across vendors or aggregating a daily news feed and sending it to my Kindle. As my projects gained attention, I started acquiring freelance clients, and before long, my lifelong hobby had transformed into my main source of income. This led me to commit fully to software development, and I've loved what I do ever since!</p>
