Welcome to my blog! This is an example post to show you how the blog formatting works.

## Why I Built This Blog

I wanted a simple, lightweight blog that matches my portfolio's aesthetic. Using Jekyll with GitHub Pages means I can write posts in Markdown (using Obsidian!) and publish them with a simple git push.

## Writing Posts from Obsidian

Here's my workflow:

1. Write and edit posts in Obsidian
2. Add Jekyll front matter at the top
3. Copy the markdown file to the `_posts` directory
4. Push to GitHub

### Front Matter Example

Every post needs front matter like this:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-01-15
categories: [category1, category2]
---
```

## Markdown Features

The blog supports all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `Inline code`

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Images

You can add images like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/photo.jpg)
```

### Videos

Embed YouTube videos with HTML:

```html
<iframe width="560" height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

## What's Next

I'm looking forward to sharing thoughts on web development, design patterns, and lessons learned from building projects like Flippd and JukeRabbit.

Stay tuned!
